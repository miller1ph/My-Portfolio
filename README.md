## Steps
1. Identify, Assess, and Evaluate Risk Profile, Investment Horizon, and overall Financial Goals / Objectives.

     - Stakeholder Risk Profile: Conservative
     - Investment Horizon: 5-6 years
     - Financial Goals: Grow the fund while ensuring:
  
             - Capital is preserved
             - Steady Income stream
             - Sufficient liquidity for emergencies for the whole duration of the Investment Horizon.
    
2. With reference to the above information and consultation with stakeholders, the following were discussed:

     - Asset Class Selection
       - Asset classes initially considered for investment include Equities, Fixed Income (Bonds), Cash and Cash Equivalents, Real Estate, Commodities, and Cryptocurrencies. However, after aligning the stakeholder's risk profile, investment horizon, and overall financial goals, it was decided to focus the investments on Cash and Cash Equivalent Instruments such as CDs, Savings Account, and Money Market Funds. The rationale for this decision are as follows (these also align with the stakeholder's financial goals/objectives):
         
                 - Cash and Cash Equivalents are the most liquid of all asset classes.
                 - These assets provide predictable and steady income streams and are not subject to market fluctuation.
                 - The current interest rates for these instruments are at MULTI-YEAR HIGHS. Current interest levels are last seen during the early 2000s.
                 - These financial assets are insured up to $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank (FDIC) / credit union (NCUA), for each account ownership category.

      - Initial Capital and Asset Allocation
       - This project commenced on May 15, 2024 with an initial capital of US$ 955,864.15. As previously discussed, capital will be invested on Cash and Cash Equivalent Instruments such as CDs, Cash, Savings Account and Money Market Funds. Initial Capital Allocation is shown below:

          As shown above, majority of the allocation were placed on CDs offered by Banks and Brokers. The rationale for the allocation are as follows:
        
           - CDs (combination of bank and brokered CDs) - 73.52%
             
             - Majority of the investments were placed on CDs to take advantage of the decade-long high interest level. There are CDs (with duration of 5 years or more) that are offering interest between 4.5% and 5%. Placing the majority of investments on such CDs would be a good idea to lock-in the high interest rate and considering the impending Federal Reserve's decision/action to cut the interest rates later this year.

         - Cash, Money Market, and Savings - 26.48%
             
             - Investments on Cash, Money Market, and Savings will be used for daily expenses, emergencies, and even buying additional CDs if attractive rates will be available in the future. These are very liquid, easy to withdraw and/or move to other investments as needed.
          

3. Risk Management

   - In order to align with the stakeholder's overall financial goals, 100% of the capital were invested in LOW-RISK investments. Furthermore, there are sufficient funds which can be easily withdrawn if needed.
   - All investments are insured by FDIC (banks) or NCUA (credit union). All allocations were computed to ensure that 100% of the funds will be covered by $250,000 per depositor per insured bank/credit union guidelines by FDIC/NCUA.
  
4. Performance Monitoring and Evaluation

   - Below is the detailed performance of each Account Type from May 15, 2024. Note that performance is measured every end of the month:

5. Performance vs Benchmark
   
     Since the majority of my holdings are in fixed-income instruments, I will be using the ISHARES CORE US AGGREGATE BOND ETF (Ticker: AGG) as BENCHMARK for this activity. Below is the overall performance of my portfolio and its relative strength (weakness) against the benchmark:

6. Strategic Adjustment
   
   - As shown on Fig. 1, the initial allocation on Cash was at 13.81%.  This would provide some flexibility whenever more attractive rates will be available in the future. As we all know, interest rates have been largely dependent on Federal Reserve's decision to raise/cut it depending on their metrics.
   
   - Since 2022, rates have climbed steadily from 0.25% up to 5.25-5.5% (August 2023). The rates remained constant since then and the Fed signified their intention to cut rates this year. The timing of the cut will depend on how fast the core inflation goes back to their target of 2%.
  
   - Update: Federal Reserve, based on their released Minutes of the Meeting (August 21, 2024), has announced that it is time to cut interest rates.  The first cut is expected to take effect in September.
  
   - Due to the news of expected rate cut, I have discussed with the stakeholders that it would be wise to utilize the Cash in the portfolio to buy additional CDs in order to lock-in the current rates. This action has changed the total Cash allocation in the portfolio from 13.81% to 0.064% in August 2024.
